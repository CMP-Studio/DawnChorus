### Description

![Dawn Chorus Screenshots](./appOverview.jpeg)

Wake up to nature’s chorus with a bird alarm clock developed by Carnegie Museum of Natural History and Innovation Studio. This artfully designed app is a calming, nature-inspired alternative to your usual blaring alarm. When the alarm goes off, birds begin to appear in trees to create a chorus of song. Hear randomly selected birds each morning, or choose from 20 birds to create a custom alarm. All of the birds are native to the northeastern United States, and users can hear their calls and learn more about them on bird cards developed with museum scientists.

Carnegie Museum of Natural History is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and is one of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. The museum is an active research institution with an environmental research center in Rector, Pennsylvania called Powdermill Nature Reserve. The birds in this app were studied at the museum, are often banded at Powdermill, or are frequently impacted by window collisions—a phenomenon that the museum helps study and prevent as part of BirdSafe Pittsburgh.

Innovation Studio is the design, development, and workflow laboratory at Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, where it supports a culture of innovation throughout the museums.
